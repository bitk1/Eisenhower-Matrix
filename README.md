# Eisenhower Matrix Task Manager

This program is very quick and easy to use once you have got used to it. It is named after the 34th president of the United Stated, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was famous for his prioritisation skills. He apparently said something like "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important, and the urgent is rarely important and the important is rarely urgent.".
